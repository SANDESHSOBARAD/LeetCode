Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        
        def dfs(p, q):
            if not p and not q: return True
            if not p or not q: return False

            return (p.val == q.val and dfs(p.left, q.left) and dfs(p.right, q.right))
        
        return dfs(p,q)
