Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.


class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        seen = set()

        for i in range(9):
            for j in range(9):
                ele = board[i][j]
                if ele != '.':
                    if (i,ele) in seen or (ele,j) in seen or (i//3,j//3,ele) in seen:
                        return False
                    
                    seen.add((i,ele))
                    seen.add((ele,j))
                    seen.add((i//3,j//3,ele))
        return True
