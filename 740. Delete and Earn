You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.
Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.

class Solution:
    def deleteAndEarn(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        maxNum = max(nums)

        points = [0] * (maxNum + 1)

        for num in nums:
            points[num] += num
        
        dp = [0] * (maxNum + 1)
        dp[0] = points[0]
        dp[1] = max(points[0], points[1])

        for i in range(2, maxNum + 1):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]+points[i])
        return dp[maxNum]
