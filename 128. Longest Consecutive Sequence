Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        longest = 0
        numset = set(nums) 

        for num in nums:
            if num - 1 not in numset:
                length = 0
                while num + length in numset:
                    length += 1
                longest = max(longest, length)
        return longest
