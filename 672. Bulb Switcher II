There is a room with n bulbs labeled from 1 to n that all are turned on initially, and four buttons on the wall. Each of the four buttons has a different functionality where:

Button 1: Flips the status of all the bulbs.
Button 2: Flips the status of all the bulbs with even labels (i.e., 2, 4, ...).
Button 3: Flips the status of all the bulbs with odd labels (i.e., 1, 3, ...).
Button 4: Flips the status of all the bulbs with a label j = 3k + 1 where k = 0, 1, 2, ... (i.e., 1, 4, 7, 10, ...).
You must make exactly presses button presses in total. For each press, you may pick any of the four buttons to press.

Given the two integers n and presses, return the number of different possible statuses after performing all presses button presses.



class Solution:
    def flipLights(self, n: int, presses: int) -> int:
        if presses == 0:
            return 1
        elif n == 1:
            return 2
        elif n == 2:
            return 3 if presses<2 else 4
        else:
            if presses == 1:
                return 4
            if presses == 2:
                return 7
            else:
                return 8
